Configuration uses the [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) file format (HOCON), but is read using
[pureconfig](https://pureconfig.github.io) library.

The configuration is stored in the `application.conf` file. You can either modify that file directly or override it
using system properties (see Typesafe Config's readme on how to do that).

## Email configuration

By default, a dummy (no-op) email sender is used. If you'd like to send real emails, you'll need to enable either the
smtp sender, or the mailgun sender by specifying the appropriate configuration options (one of `email.mailgun.enabled`
or `email.smtp.enabled` needs to be `true`).

You can also add support for another email service by implementing the `EmailSender` trait.

## Project name customization

If you want to use Bootzooka as a scaffolding for your own project, use the `renameProject` command with sbt, for
example:  

````
sbt "renameProject com.mycompany foobar"
````  

This should rename your project to **Foobar**, move all sources to top-level package `com.mycompany.foobar`.
