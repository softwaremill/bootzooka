Bootzooka is a simple application scaffolding project to allow quick start of development for modern, web based applications. If you'd like to have a jump start developing a Scala-based Single Page Application project, skipping the boring parts and focusing on the real business value, this template might be for you!

Bootzooka contains only the very basic features, that almost any application needs (listed below). These features are fully implemented both on server- and client- side. We hope that the implementations can also serve as blueprints for new functionalities.

Current (user visible) features:

* User registration
* Lost password recovery (via e-mail)
* Logging in/out
* Profile management

"Developer" features:

* integrated SBT + Grunt build
* unit & integration backend tests
* frontend JS tests
* ui tests using Selenium
* fat-jar and .war deployments

This may not sound "cool", but in fact Bootzooka is really helpful when bootstrapping a new project. This is because it contains the whole required setup and automation of build processes both for frontend and backend. You get it out of the box which means significantly less time spent on setting up infrastructure and tools and more time spent on actual coding features in project.
